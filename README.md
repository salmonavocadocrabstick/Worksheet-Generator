# Worksheet-Generator
Worksheet Generator for an ESL student

Part time gig (tutoring) had a kid who needed some extra practices on adding s / es / ies when writing with pronouns.
This set generates present tense worksheets for verb fill in the blanks.

### 1/19/2019: Attempted to modularize.
#### Originally only generates fill in the blanks (verbs) worksheets.
#### I wanted to make other types of worksheets but the original design
#### was not friendly enough to allow any possible extension.
#### I redid the entire structure of the whole script, and now the program
#### can do the following:
####	- Generate fill in the blanks (verbs)
####	- Generate fill in the blanks (nouns)
####	- Generate sentence rearrangment practices
####	- Generate questions for student to answer.
